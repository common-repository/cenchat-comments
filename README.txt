Messaging for websites and blogs

== Description ==

Cenchat provides a better way to engage with the audiences of those who have opted to disable or thinking of disabling their comment section.

It’s a realtime chat-based solution where your audiences are only allowed to send private messages to you. You can then publicize those chats as read-only so the insightful ones can stand out.

= Why Cenchat? =

Comments have evolved as social media has taken over it. This is because people are already in it and it’s there where they share and talk about stories across the web. Lots of popular sites have already disabled their comment section in order to adapt. This makes it easier for the bloggers as they don't have to moderate their comment section.

The problem with disabling your comment section is that your blog may feel inhospitable as it doesn’t encourage dialog. It would also be more difficult for your audiences to directly engage with you—preventing you to provide value beyond your content.

Cenchat helps your blog to adapt to these changes by letting the community conversations happen in social media and still keep an open channel for people that wants to get further insights directly from you.

Here are a few more reasons why you should use Cenchat:

**No ads**

Our business model doesn’t revolve around tracking users and showing them ads. Instead, we plan to introduce a pricing model where we’ll still offer a generous free tier.

Ultimately, our goal is to convert the big publishers into paying customers in order to sustain our business.

**Faster**

Cenchat is designed to be lazy loaded so it wouldn’t be a bottleneck for your blog. It also only loads just the absolute necessary needed for your audience to start engaging with you.

Since Cenchat is a chat-based solution you can also expect the same speed and responsiveness you get with your favorite messaging apps.

**Better privacy**

We take privacy seriously and we strive to be better than others when it comes to it. When we get information about you, we take less. The only data we want is the data that will make Cenchat work for you.

Anonymous accounts are a big part of Cenchat because chats can be made public by the blogger without the user’s consent. However, anonymity always goes hand-in-hand with online harassment.

With how Cenchat is designed in which every chat is private by default, harassment can then be kept at a minimum.

**Data management**

Not only do we value your privacy, we also value your data and want to put you in control of it. We allow everyone to delete their account on Cenchat.

When this happens, your chats will continue to exist but anonymized to keep the context of the discussion. Everything else on our servers that’s identifiable to you will however be deleted.

*We currently don’t support exporting your data but this is in our immediate pipeline.*
